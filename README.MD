# NixOS flake and home-manager config

Welcome to my personal repository for NixOS and home-manager configuration. I hope you find it useful and inspiring for your own setup.

## **Prerequisites**

- Before you dive into the code, please note that this configuration always assumes that your hosts directories contain a configuration.nix file and a hardware-configuration.nix file.

**Credit:** I would like to express my sincere gratitude to [Gerg-L](https://github.com/Gerg-L/nix-templates/tree/master) for sharing his minimalist flake example repo and his valuable time. He taught me a lot about how to use flakes and home-manager effectively. I also want to thank the amazing community on Discord [Nix/NixOS (unofficial)](https://discord.gg/qPJBy7qdUX) that keeps on teaching me new things about NixOS every day. You guys rock!
