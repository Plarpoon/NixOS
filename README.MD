# NixOS flake and home-manager config

My personal repository for NixOS and home-manager configuration

**Credit:** A huge thanks to [Gerg-L](https://github.com/Gerg-L/nix-templates/tree/master) for providing his minimalist flake example repo and the amazing community on Discord [Nix/NixOS (unofficial)](https://discord.gg/qPJBy7qdUX) that keep on teaching me a lot about NixOS.
